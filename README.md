# Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and diagnostic data. The goal is to support early detection and intervention by identifying key features that indicate the likelihood of ASD. By analyzing patterns in the data, the model aims to provide a reliable and scalable solution for assisting healthcare professionals and researchers.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, data normalization, and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements and compares various algorithms such as Random Forest classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, XGBoost Classifier Algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Provides metrics like accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report to assess model performance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays insights from the data and model predictions using graphs and charts.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains behavioral and diagnostic data related to Autism Spectrum Disorder. It includes key features such as:
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Screening test scores
- Jaundice
- Ethnicity

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Autism_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the specified directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.
3. Train the model using the provided training script.
4. Evaluate the model on test data and visualize the results.

## Results
- **Model Performance**: Summarize the accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report evaluation metrics of the best-performing model.
- **Insights**: Highlight any interesting patterns or correlations discovered in the data.

## Applications
This project can be applied in:
- Assisting healthcare professionals with early ASD screening.
- Enhancing research in autism diagnosis and behavioral analysis.

## Limitations
- The model’s accuracy depends on the quality and size of the dataset.
- Predictions are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis.

## Future Work
- Integration of additional datasets to improve model robustness.
- Utilization of OpenCV for the detection of autism, enabling efficient and accurate image processing.
- Implementation of deep learning techniques for enhanced performance.
- Deployment of the model as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
